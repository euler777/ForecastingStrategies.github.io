# Forecasting Strategies

Businesses rely on forecasts of sales to plan production, justify marketing decisions and guide research. There are 3 general strategies to forecast. The first one is to find good predictors X that lead to the values of response Y . The closer the relationship and the longer the lead time, the better this strategy becomes. This strategy is often related to regressions. In many applications, we cannot rely on finding a suitable set of predictors and have to try other methods. A second approach, common in marketing, is to use information about the sales of similar products in the past. The influential Bass diffusion model is based on this principle. A third strategy is to make extrapolations based on present trends continuing and to implement adaptive estimates of these trends.

Main goal: To model count data by using generalized linear regressions; to estimate the total sales items using Bass model; to estimate non-seasonal time series using the exponential smoothing estimation method.
